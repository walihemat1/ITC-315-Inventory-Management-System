# Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a web-based application designed to help small businesses or organizations efficiently manage their product inventory.  
It allows users to add, edit, and delete products, record stock-in and stock-out operations, track current stock levels, and get alerts when items are running low.  
The system also provides a dashboard with key inventory statistics and simple reports, enabling managers to make informed decisions about ordering and stock management.  
This project was developed as a Software Engineering final project using the Scrum methodology to practice agile development, teamwork, and good software engineering practices.
